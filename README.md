 <p align="center">
React, Typescript, and Fortmatic's API, for authentication and transacting with the frontend.
</p>

## The project utilizes the Fortmatic's api and is a way to interact with the both frontend and backend.

The purpose of this project is to create a simple UI that will interact with Fortmatic's capabilities an example of this will be, authentication with phone number, transfering crypto currency, approving and lastly any other functions that you will use to transact with your contract.

## Run project

```typescript
  npm install
```

```typescript
  npm start
```

## Before using login in you will need to use your own api key.

Go ahead and head over to https://fortmatic.com/ and sign up to get your key

## Progress so far...

I may extend on this project and create a personal contract on top of it. But so far here is the UI...
